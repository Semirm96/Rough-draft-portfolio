            Hi, My name is Semir Mujkic and I have been an electrician for 5
           years. Throughout my time as an electrician I have decided that 
           while I am good at what I do I've decided I want to try my hand
           at making a career change to something I'd be able to enjoy much
           more than what I have now. I've grown to be a worker that constantly 
           works on perfecting every task I receive to the best of my ability 
           and to never stop learning new and faster ways to achieve the 
           projected end result within a timely manner.

            </p>

            <p class="text">
            In my time I've also grown to enjoy alot of things related to computers,
            like coding, playing games, and overall just enjoying all there is to 
            offer on the internet and I figured I could also enjoy a career in being
            a fullstack web developer. My time off the computer and work basically 
            revolves spending time with my wife and son who is 2 years old at this point
            so my life is pretty much always occupied and making this career change 
            would give me a valid excuse to be on computers more, which makes it 
            an even better idea for me in the long run. 
            
            </p>
